Since I personally believe, Modular object oriented development is the proper way to approach development,

1) Input module
2) URL Connection module
3) Parser module
4) Update module

Pandas is the best framework as it offers similar performance regarless of the size of input, whereas
other modules eg, CSV modules slow down as input size scales

connection request is sent out, if cconnection is succesful,
